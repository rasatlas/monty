# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Compilation & Output
Your code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
Any output must be printed on stdout
Any error message must be printed on stderr
Here is a link to a GitHub repository that could help you making sure your errors are printed on stderr

# Requirements
# General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project.

# Compilation & Output
* Your code will be compiled this way: $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
* Any output must be printed on stdout
* Any error message must be printed on stderr

# The monty program
* Usage: monty file
	- where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
* If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
	- where <file> is the name of the file
* If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
	- where is the line number where the instruction appears.
	- Line numbers always start at 1
* The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
	- it executed properly every line of the file
	- it finds an error in the file
	- an error occured
* If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
* You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
